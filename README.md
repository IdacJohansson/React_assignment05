### Work with APIs: 

Look up an API that you want to use for your project.  

Import your API to your project.  

Create a list of different items(ex. movies, books, games). Each item should have a their own properties that you get from your API 

Create a search bar. In this search-bar, the user should be able to search for a specifik item that they are looking for
